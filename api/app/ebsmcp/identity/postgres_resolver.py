"""Real identity resolution, replacing StubIdentityResolver: looks up the
caller's currently-open mapping (effective_end_date IS NULL — the same
invariant enforced at the schema layer by identity-service's partial
unique index) and its Org ID scope from the identity-mapping database.

This is the on-prem, low-latency path the architecture doc calls for:
identity resolution sits in the hot path of every tool call, so it's a
direct indexed DB read here, not an HTTP call to management-api (which
stays reserved for admin onboarding, out of that hot path).

        (entra_subject, environment, target_system, coalesce(domain,'')), so
        a functional user with both a finance and an scm grant is two valid
        rows, not a data error. This used to SELECT ... .first(), which
        silently returned whichever row the database happened to hand back —
        a caller could be handed the wrong domain's role and org scope with
        nothing anywhere saying so.

        The union is the broader of the grants the person actually holds,
        never wider than that: org IDs are combined, and the entitlement
        filter still treats the result as a ceiling a request may narrow but
        never widen.

        ebs_dba is unaffected — its domain is always NULL, so at most one
        mapping can be open and the single-mapping path is byte-identical to
        the old behaviour.
